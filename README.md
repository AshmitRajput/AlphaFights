### This is a basic 2D platformer game with a main player and bats as enemies, 
this is my attempt at learning my skills and polishing my skills as a game developer.
This file contains all the assets used in the GODOT Engine and all the code related to the elements of the game. In every folder you will find png files as assets
and .gd extension files as codes in gdscript for the particular elemant, the .tscn extension represents a scene for that element. there are audio files and other files with different 
extensions that cannot be opened here but only on Godot game engine.
